# Resampling-Techniques-for-Imbalanced-Classification-RUS-ROS-Cluster-Centroids-SMOTE-
The goal of this project is to use resampling methods like oversampling, undersampling, Cluster Centroids, and SMOTE to correct imbalanced datasets.  To compare how each approach enhances minority class prediction, a Logistic Regression model is trained.
